/*
In MySQL, you can use transactions, but once a transaction is started, you can only roll it back or commit it; 
you cannot set intermediate savepoints within the transaction to which you can later roll back. 
If you want to roll back to a certain point within a transaction, you'll need to structure your code accordingly, 
possibly by using conditional logic or by breaking the transaction into smaller transactions.
