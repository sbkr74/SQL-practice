You are absolutely right! Using a query like:
## 59. Write a Query to display the details of emps whose Sal is same as of <br> a) Employee Sal of EMP1 table.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT E.*
FROM EMP E
JOIN EMP EMP1 ON E.SAL = EMP1.SAL;
```

**is essentially performing a self-join**, and in this specific scenario, there might not be much value if the purpose is simply to find rows with matching salaries within the same table (`EMP`).

---

### **When and Why to Use a Self-Join in This Context**
A **self-join** like the one above becomes meaningful when:
1. **You Need to Compare Rows Within the Same Table for Additional Context**  
   For example, if you also need to compare based on another attribute, such as `DEPTNO`, `JOB`, or `MGR`.

   **Example**: Finding employees who share the same salary but work in different departments:
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT E.EMPNO, E.ENAME, E.SAL, E.DEPTNO AS DEPT_E,
                   EMP1.DEPTNO AS DEPT_EMP1
   FROM EMP E
   JOIN EMP EMP1 ON E.SAL = EMP1.SAL
   WHERE E.DEPTNO <> EMP1.DEPTNO;
   ```

2. **When Filtering or Enforcing Unique Relationships**  
   - To ensure you're comparing a record to others and not to itself, you might add an additional condition such as `E.EMPNO <> EMP1.EMPNO`.

   **Example**: Employees with matching salaries but not the same `EMPNO`:
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT E.*
   FROM EMP E
   JOIN EMP EMP1 ON E.SAL = EMP1.SAL
   WHERE E.EMPNO <> EMP1.EMPNO;
   ```

3. **When Building Complex Relationships or Aggregations**  
   Self-joins can also be combined with aggregations, which cannot be directly achieved without them.  
   **Example**: Finding employees who earn the maximum salary in their department:
   ```sql
   SELECT E.*
   FROM EMP E
   JOIN (
       SELECT DEPTNO, MAX(SAL) AS MAX_SAL
       FROM EMP
       GROUP BY DEPTNO
   ) MAXSAL ON E.DEPTNO = MAXSAL.DEPTNO AND E.SAL = MAXSAL.MAX_SAL;
   ```

---

### **Direct Query Without Self-Join**
If you simply want employees with matching salaries within the same table, you could achieve this **without a self-join** using a **grouping query**:
```sql
SELECT SAL
FROM EMP
GROUP BY SAL
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

This will give you the salaries that are shared by multiple employees. You can then fetch the details:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL IN (
    SELECT SAL
    FROM EMP
    GROUP BY SAL
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
```

---

### **When Not to Use Self-Joins**
- If thereâ€™s no relational or comparative context (like comparing rows within the table), self-joins only add unnecessary complexity and can hurt query performance.
- In scenarios like this, simpler queries (like the direct query above) are more efficient and easier to understand.
